# Cucumber-Puppeteer: BDD Testing Framework

## Overview:

Built a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework using Cucumber and Puppeteer, enabling easy-to-write, human-readable automated tests. This framework empowers developers, product managers, and marketing teams to collaborate on defining and validating user experiences with minimal technical overhead.

## Key Features:

• BDD with Cucumber – Uses Gherkin syntax for writing tests in a natural language format.
• Headless Browser Automation – Leverages Puppeteer to simulate real-world interactions in Chrome.
• Developer-Friendly – Simplifies test creation with reusable step definitions and modular design.
• Readable for Non-Engineers – Product and marketing teams can understand and contribute to test scenarios.
• Seamless CI/CD Integration – Automates end-to-end testing in deployment pipelines.

## Impact:

Bridged the gap between engineering, product, and marketing by making test cases accessible to all stakeholders.
Accelerated test coverage by enabling rapid test creation and execution.
Enhanced product quality with reliable, automated UI testing.
